    "Access to health care services is defined as \"the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best health outcomes.\" (Millman M, 1993). Having or not having access to health care services can have a great impact on a person's physical and mental health, and consequently affect a person's quality of life. More broadly it has an effect on the public health of a given society.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to health care services requires: being able to find health care services within a specific geographic area, having insurance coverage, finding a good health care provider and other factors. This project will focus on studying select disparate geographic regions in the United States to discover similarities and differences as it relates to being able to access health care services. Specifically, the project will focus on answering the questions: Are there certain regions that have better access to health care services than others? What are the shared characteristics of these regions that make them have better or worse access to health care services? For example, anecdotal evidence appears to indicate low income neighborhoods often have fewer health care providers, hospitals and other health care resources than areas with higher income. This project will use available data to attempt to answer these questions more definitively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to these questions could provide valuable insights to public health officials. The hope is this information would be useful in guiding policy related to expanding health care services to areas that really need it. "

The total health care services in the region is the sum of all different categories of medical centers gathered through the Foursquare API.  A low ratio of people to medical centers indicates higher access to care, meaning the population has more options available for care.  This measure which was named “PeopleToMedicalCenters” was chosen as the dependent variable of the study."

A low ratio of people to medical centers indicates higher access to care, meaning the population has more options available for care.  This ratio served as the target variable for the study.

When a population was made up of 70.7% or less of white people, the population was later classified as having a high or medium ratio of people to medical centers. This was further broken down by the next most prominent variable, the unemployment rate. When a population had an unemployment rate of 3.95% or less, the population was classified as having a medium ratio of people to medical centers otherwise it was classified to have a high ratio."

    "The results of correlation analysis and decision classification model appear to agree that the racial make-up of a county is strongly associated with higher access to health care services for people living in the county. Specifically, for the counties in the study, if a county is largely made up of people classified as white from the US Census Bureau data, the county has a lower ratio of people to medical centers which means higher access to health care services for its population. This information can be used by policy makers to further study the underlying causes and to design intervention efforts to provide higher access for these minority populations. Suggestions would be to look at the relationship between race, unemployment and income.\n",

    "The results of correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis appear to agree that if a county has a larger population of people 62 and older, the county has a lower ratio of people to medical centers which means higher access to health care services for its population. This could be explained by the fact that this population is largely made up of retirees who have Medicare healthcare coverage and are able to afford health care services. This information could be used by policy makers to increase access to insurance coverage that seems to be indirectly associated with higher access to care.\n",

    "The results of multiple linear regression analysis and decision classification model appear to agree that if a county has a higher unemployment rate, the county has a higher ratio of people to medical centers which means lower access to health care services for its population. It appears to support anecdotal evidence that people that are unemployed and consequently have lower income have lower access to care. Knowing this, policy makers can look for ways to assist people who are unemployed to be able to pay for health care services, which could as a result boost access to health care for a county’s population.

    "In conclusion this limited study provided useful insights that could be used to guide policy changes to ensure everyone has improved access to health care services. The study revealed race, age and unemployment are the primary factors that affect a population’s access to care. In answering the questions posed in the introductory section; Higher access to health care services was associated with counties with a large percent of white people, a large percent of people 62 years and older and lower unemployment rate.\n",

    "Future studies could improve on this work by expanding the area of study to include a larger number of counties across the United States. The study could also be improved by using other sources to complement the Foursquare API places which in some cases appeared to be incomplete. Other research could also explore the underlying reasons for why these factors have an impact on access to health care services."
